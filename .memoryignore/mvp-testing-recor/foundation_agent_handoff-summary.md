## Preprocessing Pipeline

### 1. Data Filtering
- **Filtered zero sales records:** 172,871 records (17.0% of data)
- Rationale: Zero sales indicate store closed days, don't contribute to sales prediction
- **Final training samples:** 844,338 records

### 2. Missing Value Handling
- `CompetitionDistance`: Filled with median
- `CompetitionOpenSinceMonth/Year`: Filled with 0 (no competition)
- `Promo2SinceWeek/Year`: Filled with 0 (no promo)
- `PromoInterval`: Filled with 'None'
- `Open` (test set): Filled with 1 (assumed open)

### 3. Feature Engineering

#### Temporal Features (8 features)
- Year, Month, Day, WeekOfYear, Quarter
- Derived from Date column

#### Competition Features (1 feature)
- `CompetitionMonthsOpen`: Calculated duration since competition opened
- Handles cases where competition data is missing (set to 0)

#### Promo Features (2 features)
- `Promo2WeeksActive`: Duration since Promo2 started
- `IsPromoMonth`: Binary flag if current month is in PromoInterval

### 4. Label Encoding
Categorical variables encoded:
- StateHoliday
- StoreType
- Assortment
- PromoInterval

## Feature Set (17 Features)

### Store Characteristics
1. Store (ID)
2. StoreType (a, b, c, d)
3. Assortment (a, b, c)
4. CompetitionDistance
5. CompetitionMonthsOpen

### Temporal Features
6. DayOfWeek (1-7)
7. Year
8. Month
9. Day
10. WeekOfYear
11. Quarter

### Promotional Features
12. Promo (0/1)
13. Promo2 (0/1)
14. Promo2WeeksActive
15. IsPromoMonth (0/1)

### Holiday Features
16. StateHoliday (encoded)
17. SchoolHoliday (0/1)

## Data Split Strategy

- **Train/Validation Split:** Time-based split
- **Split Date:** 2015-06-19
- **Training Samples:** 804,056
- **Validation Samples:** 40,282
- **Rationale:** Last ~6 weeks (42 days) used for validation to simulate real-world forecasting scenario

## Performance Analysis

### RMSPE Baseline Comparison
| Model | Train RMSPE | Val RMSPE | Overfit Gap |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Gradient Boosting | 0.2671 | 0.2735 | 0.0064 |
| Random Forest | 0.2739 | 0.2901 | 0.0162 |

### Key Observations
1. **Gradient Boosting performs best** with lowest validation RMSPE
2. **Minimal overfitting** in both models (small train/val gap)
3. **RMSPE ~0.27** is a solid baseline for store sales prediction
4. Random Forest shows slightly more overfitting than GB

## Recommendations for Next Agent (Refinement Agent)

### 1. Hyperparameter Tuning Priorities
- **Gradient Boosting:** Focus here (best baseline)
  - Tune: n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample
  - Try: 200-500 estimators with lower learning rate (0.01-0.05)
  - Consider: early stopping to prevent overfitting

- **Random Forest:** Secondary priority
  - Tune: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split
  - Consider: Feature importance analysis for feature selection

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering
- **Store-level features:**
  - Rolling sales statistics (mean, median, std over 7/14/30 days)
  - Store vs. Store Type performance ratios
  - Store sales trend (linear regression slope)

- **Lag features:**
  - Sales lag 1, 7, 14 days
  - Promo lag features (was promo active last week?)

- **Interaction features:**
  - Promo × DayOfWeek
  - StoreType × Assortment
  - Holiday × Promo

### 3. Model Exploration
- **If OpenMP available:**
  - Train XGBoost and LightGBM (research suggests they may outperform)
  - LightGBM recommended for speed with large datasets

- **Alternative approaches:**
  - Store-specific models (train separate model per store type)
  - Target transformation (log transform to handle skewness)

### 4. Validation Strategy
- **Cross-validation:** Consider time-series CV (3-5 folds)
- **Metric focus:** RMSPE (primary), RMSE (secondary)
- **Ensure:** No data leakage, especially with lag/rolling features

### 5. Known Challenges
- Zero sales handling: Current approach filters them out
  - Alternative: Two-stage model (predict open/closed, then sales)
- Missing competition data: Currently using median/zero imputation
  - Alternative: More sophisticated imputation or separate models
- Promo interval: Text parsing could be improved
