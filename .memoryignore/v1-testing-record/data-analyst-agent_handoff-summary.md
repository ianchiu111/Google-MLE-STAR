---

## Critical Insights for Model Development

### 1. HIGH PRIORITY: Zero Sales Records (17%)
**Finding:** 172,871 records with zero sales (store closed days)
**Impact:** High - will bias models if not handled
**Recommendation:** Filter out (Open=0) OR model separately
**Aligned with:** ML Research recommendation for data cleaning

### 2. HIGH PRIORITY: Missing Values Pattern
**Features Affected:**
- CompetitionDistance: 2,642 missing (0.26%)
- CompetitionOpenSince: 323,348 missing (31.8%)
- Promo2Since: 508,031 missing (49.9%)
- PromoInterval: 508,031 missing (49.9%)

**Impact:** High - affects competition and promotion features
**Recommendation:** Test BOTH approaches:
1. Non-imputed localized models (2025 research finding)
2. Traditional imputation (forward-fill, median)

**Aligned with:** ML Research finding that non-imputed may outperform

### 3. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Strong Feature Signals
**Day of Week:** 40% variance (Mon/Sun peak, Saturday lowest)
**Promotions:** 39% sales lift (mean: $8,229 vs $5,930)
**Store Type:** 48% variance (Type 'b': $10,233 vs Type 'd': $6,822)
**Seasonality:** 31% December boost ($8,609 vs $6,565 avg)

**Impact:** High - these are your strongest predictors
**Recommendation:** Priority features for engineering and ablation studies

## Feature Engineering Priorities (VALIDATED)

### Tier 1: Critical Features (Implement First)

#### Temporal Features
- DayOfWeek (cyclical encoding: sin/cos)
- Month, Quarter, Year
- Weekend/Weekday indicators
- Days to/from month end
- Week of year
- Holiday indicators (state + school)

**Rationale:** 40% variance by day of week, strong monthly patterns

#### Lag Features
- Sales lag: 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 days
- Same day of week (previous 1-4 weeks)
- Rolling statistics: mean, std, median (7/14/28/90 day windows)
- Rolling quantiles (25th, 75th percentiles)

**Rationale:** Time series data - historical patterns critical

#### Promotion Features
- Promo indicator (current)
- Promo2 participation
- Days in/out of promotion
- Promotion frequency (last 30/60/90 days)
- Promo × DayOfWeek interaction

**Rationale:** 39% sales lift during promotions

#### Store Features
- Store type (categorical or embeddings)
- Assortment type
- Competition distance
- Competition age (months since opening)
- Store historical performance (mean, std sales)

**Rationale:** 48% variance across store types

### Tier 2: Derived Features (Implement After Baseline)
- Customers per sale ratio
- Sales per customer
- Store performance vs peer group
- Promotion effectiveness (sales lift)
- Holiday effects by store type

---

## Model Development Strategy - VALIDATED

### Phase 2: Baseline Models (READY TO START)

**Model 1: LightGBM Localized Per-Store** (RECOMMENDED FIRST)
- Priority: CRITICAL
- Expected RMSPE: 0.10-0.12
- Training Time: 0.5-1.0 hours
- Strategy: Individual models per store
- Data: Use non-imputed approach first

**Model 2: XGBoost Global with Store Features**
- Priority: CRITICAL
- Expected RMSPE: 0.11-0.13
- Training Time: 1.0-2.0 hours
- Strategy: Single global model
- Data: Encode stores as features

**Model 3: Random Forest + Linear Regression Ensemble**
- Priority: HIGH
- Expected RMSPE: 0.13-0.15
- Training Time: 0.3-0.5 hours
- Strategy: Fast interpretable baseline

### Key Insight from ML Research
"Feature engineering > model complexity" - 1st place winner spent 50% time on features, NOT model tuning.

---

## Validation Strategy - APPROVED

### Primary Metric
**RMSPE (Root Mean Square Percentage Error)**
- Formula: sqrt(mean((actual - predicted)^2 / actual^2))
- This is the Kaggle competition metric
- Emphasizes percentage errors

### Secondary Metrics
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- R² Score

### Validation Approach
**Time-Series Split:**
- Train on historical data
- Validate on subsequent 6 weeks
- Multiple splits for stability assessment
- NO FUTURE DATA LEAKAGE

**Cross-Validation:**
- Time-series K-fold with forward chaining (5 folds)
- Respect temporal order
- Never use future information

---

## Data Preprocessing Checklist - READY FOR ML DEVELOPER

### Step 1: Data Cleaning
- [ ] Remove closed store days (Sales=0, Open=0) OR separate modeling
- [ ] Validate date continuity
- [ ] Check for data leakage (no future information in features)
- [ ] Handle store renovations/closures

### Step 2: Missing Value Handling
**TEST BOTH APPROACHES:**

**Approach A: Non-Imputed (2025 Research Recommendation)**
- Keep missing values as sparse
- Use localized models per store
- May outperform imputation

**Approach B: Traditional Imputation**
- Competition data: Large value (no competition) OR "missing" category
- Promo2 data: Missing = not participating
- Forward-fill or median imputation

### Step 3: Feature Engineering
- [ ] Implement Tier 1 temporal features
- [ ] Implement Tier 1 lag features (ensure no leakage at boundaries)
- [ ] Implement Tier 1 promotion features
- [ ] Implement Tier 1 store features
- [ ] Validate no data leakage in rolling statistics

### Step 4: Train/Val/Test Split
- [ ] Use time-based split (not random)
- [ ] Training: 2013-01-01 to early 2015
- [ ] Validation: Mid 2015 (6 weeks)
- [ ] Test: 2015-08-01 to 2015-09-17 (final 6 weeks)

## Success Criteria - TARGETS

### Baseline Performance Targets
- **Minimum Acceptable:** RMSPE < 0.15 (functional baseline)
- **Good Baseline:** RMSPE < 0.13 (Top 20-30% Kaggle)
- **Excellent Baseline:** RMSPE < 0.11 (Top 10%)

### After Refinement + Ensemble
- **Target:** RMSPE < 0.10 (Top 5% potential)

### Time Targets (MLE-STAR)
- **Baseline Phase:** 3-4 hours (parallelizable)
- **Total Workflow:** 17-22 hours (can be reduced with parallelization)

---

## Critical Warnings for ML Developer

### 1. DATA LEAKAGE RISK - HIGH
**Where:** Rolling statistics, lag features at temporal boundaries
**Prevention:**
- Ensure rolling windows only use past data
- Validate feature creation dates vs prediction dates
- Use time-series cross-validation

### 2. OVERFITTING RISK - MEDIUM
**Where:** Store-specific features with sparse statistics
**Prevention:**
- Use multiple validation periods
- Reserve true holdout test set
- Monitor validation vs train performance gap

### 3. ZERO SALES HANDLING - CRITICAL
**Issue:** 17% of data has zero sales (closed stores)
**Solutions:**
1. Filter out closed days (Open=0) - RECOMMENDED
2. Model separately (binary classification + regression)
3. Use as feature but don't train on those samples

### 4. MISSING VALUE APPROACH - TEST BOTH
**Recent Research Finding (2025):** Non-imputed localized models outperform traditional imputation
**Action:** Implement both approaches in baseline phase, compare performance
