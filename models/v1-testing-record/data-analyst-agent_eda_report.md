## Dataset Overview

- Training samples: 1,017,209
- Test samples: 41,088
- Number of stores: 1115
- Train period: 941 days

## Target Variable - Sales

- Mean: $5,773.82
- Median: $5,744.00
- Range: $0.00 - $41,551.00
- Zero sales: 16.99%

## Key Insights

- HIGH: 17.0% of records have zero sales - likely store closed days. Filter or handle separately.
- MEDIUM: Missing values in 6 features - most in competition and promo data. Imputation needed.
- INFO: Dataset spans multiple years with strong seasonal patterns. Time-based features critical.
- INFO: Multiple store types and assortments with different sales patterns. Store segmentation recommended.
- INFO: Promotions show significant impact on sales. Promo features are important predictors.

## Recommendations

1. Filter out closed stores (Open=0) or model separately
2. Handle missing competition and promo data with forward-fill or median imputation
3. Engineer temporal features: day of week, month, year, week of year, holidays
4. Create store-specific features: average sales, trend, seasonality
5. Feature engineering: lag features, rolling statistics, competition features
6. Consider separate models or ensemble for different store types
7. Validate for data leakage - ensure no future information in training
8. Use appropriate evaluation metric (likely RMSPE based on Kaggle competition)
